Interpreting column names as follows:
Freq.A1:	Allele frequency
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
P:	p-Value
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
OR:	Odds ratio (1 --> no effect; above 1 --> A1 is risk increasing)

Reading sumstats from clozuk_pgc2.meta.sumstats.txt into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 8171061 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= -0.1.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 1670587 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
6500474 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (6500474 SNPs remain).
Median value of OR was 0.99957, which seems sensible.
