Check enrichment of neuron and non-neuron DE genes in region-dependent eQTLs
================================================================

We used the RNA-seq data obtained from sorted cell populations (described here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/29/428391) to identify differentially expressed genes between neurons and non-neurons (NeuN+ vs NeuN-). Among the 44,338 genes from this cell sorted RNA-seq dataset that match our dataset based on Ensembl gene ids (95.6% were matched), there are 9,848 (22.21%) differentially genes between the neurons and non-neurons (neuron > non-neuron: 3,439, non-neuron > neuron: 6,409) at FDR<5%. We observed that 41.49% of the unique genes in our brain-region dependent eQTLs across all features (1,798 based on Ensembl IDs) are differentially expressed between neurons and non-neurons, which is significantly higher than the 22.21% (p=3.601e-86, one sided proportion test) observed in the sorted RNA-seq data. Comparable results are obtained if we focus on the 205,618 SNP-feature pairs obtained excluding the transcript level eQTLs (41.91%, p=9.124e-82).
