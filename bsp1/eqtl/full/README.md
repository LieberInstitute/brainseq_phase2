BrainSeq Phase I eQTL replication
=================================


To give a little background, we had initially submitted BrainSeq Phase I (polyA+ RNA-seq on DLPFC, Jaffe et al Nature neuroscience, 2018) for publication in October 2016 (and was available on bioRxiv in April 2017) - that manuscript used older processing (TopHat2 instead of HISAT2 here) to the previous genome build (hg19 versus hg38 here) and older annotation (Ensembl v75 versus Gencode v25 - which expands Ensembl v85 - here). Therefore, due to these differences, the interpretations of direct comparisons between the results in BrainSeq Phase I and II are challenging. To facilitate these comparisons, we reprocessed the BrainSeq Phase I DLPFC polyA+ dataset through the same pipeline.

Each of the four expression features assessed in BrainSeq Phase II showed high directionality agreement DLPFC RiboZero SNP-feature eQTL pairs identified at FDR<1% when compared to BrainSeq Phase I DLPFC polyA+ (gene: 90.9%, exon: 91.5%, junction: 84.4%, transcript: 91.7%) on the genotype regression coefficient. Even when considering both directionality and a nominal P-value < 0.05 in BrainSeq Phase I DLPFC polyA+, we still observed a very strong agreement (gene: 81.8%, exon: 82.1%, junction: 73.6%, transcript: 81.2%). All of these numbers are considerably higher than what we observed when assessing eQTL replication using GTEx DLPFC data (ie gene-level: 81.8% in Phase1 versus 32.5% in GTEx). Just like with the GTEx data, we display these replication statistics in our eQTL browser (only for DLPFC) at http://eqtl.brainseq.org/phase2/eqtl/.
