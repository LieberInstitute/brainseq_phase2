Check development after adjusting for NeuN cell type proportion
===============================================================


We used the estimated RNA fraction (see [cellComp](../../cellComp) directory) and re-ran our DEG analysis adjusting for the Neuronal estimated RNA fraction.

We used 614 samples for the DEG analysis across development, out of which 412 had matching DNAm data and cell type proportion estimates. Using the 412 samples, we re-ran our DEG analysis adjusting for the NeuN estimated proportion. Across all features, we found a negligible amount of features with P-bonferroni <1% that donâ€™t satisfy this threshold in the original model. In contrast, the great majority of features with P-bonferroni <1% in the original model failed to meet this threshold after adjusting for NeuN proportion. This result was significant across all features (largest p-value 3.859747 x 10-60). This result is in line with our previous work (Jaffe et al, Nat Neuro 2015) where we observed strong confounding by cell type across development.

The tables below show the number of features that are either null in both models, DE in the original model only, DE in the Neuron RNA fraction adjusted model only, or DE in both models where DE is assed by a P-bonferroni <1%. In the second table we additionally require that the DE call replicate in BrainSpan by having a P-value <5%.

The following plot shows the F-statistics from the original model against the NeuN adjusted model with DE determined by P-bonferroni<1% and requiring replication in BrainSpan.
